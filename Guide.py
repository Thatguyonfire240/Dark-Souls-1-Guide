                The focus of this guide is achievements. This will not run through every possible item in the
            game, even loot spot, every item drop. For the most part, the instructions will take you from the
            previous point to the next point of interest skipping everything along the way.
    
                Note: Bonfires will be labeled with their names AND their description. This is due to the fact that
            the player will not be able to see the names of the bonfire until they obtain a certain item. Also
            due to the nature of the game (no warping until late game), I will also cover the areas the player
            must traverse in between areas up until the ability to warp is obtained.
    
            Things you need to 100% Dark Souls
                . Can be done on multiple characters.
                . Shards, Large Shards, Large Chunks, and Slabs of all colors
                . All Sorceries
                . All Miracles
                . All Pyromancies
                . All Unique Weapons
                . 2.5 Playthroughs Solo
                . 2 Playthroughs Co-op
                . DLC content is NOT required for any collection achievement.
    
            Why is Co-op only 2 playthroughs?
                For 100%, you need all Unique Weapons and the Soul of Great Wolf Sif is required 3 times. In
            solo, you would need to defeat Sif in NG, NG+, and NG++. Then in NG++, make it to the Giant
            Blacksmith in Anor Londo and forge the third Sif weapon. (Greatsword of Artorias, Greatsword of
            Artorias (Cursed), and Greatshield of Artorias)
    
                In Co-op, if you and your friends are sharing weapons, you can drop weapons to each other.
            Since Boss Souls are not shared between games, By the end of your second playthrough, you
            would have a combined 4 Soul of Great Wolf Sif easily getting the three requirement.
    
                Side Note: Gwyn's Soul actually forces you into NG++ regardless as you cannot get his Soul and
            stay in the current playthrough. If you're doing in coop, it's okay for both players to make the
            Great Lord Greatsword after the first playthrough and then do the Miracle after the second
            playthrough (unless you're in faith build). Then you would only have to make it to the Sunlight
            Altar in NG++.""")

            Character Setup
                . While the Master Key is probably the best starting item, I will not be writing the guide to
                  force players to pick that Master Key in terms of routes, so that will be up to you.
                . Note: Master Key is by far the best item to pick, but this can be purchased for 5,000 souls
                  fairly early into the game.
            Undead Asylum
                . After the opening cutscene, loot the Dungeon Cell Key and free yourself. Go down the hall
                  turn to your left for your first donfire. Quick note: The weapon you pick up here is required
                  much later on in the game. Make sure you keep the Straight Sword Hilt.
                . Bonfire: Undead Asylum1 | Courtyard
                            Enkindle - light bonfire flame
                . Enter the doorway in front of you. You will face the first boss. Now, if you defeat him here
                  and now with your Straight Sword Hilt, your will get a weapon required for Knight's Honor,
                  Demon's Great Hammer. For beginners, this is tough to do unless the player selects Black
                  Firebombs as their item of choice or simply complete this task using NG+ or trade a Sack
                  with the Snuggly the Crow.
                . Otherwise, simply run to the gate to your left.
                . Bonfire: Undead Asylum 2 | After Asylum Demon
                . Continue here. The items here will be part of your starting gear for your class. Keep going
                  until you reach a fork, go right then you should spot some stairs. A hollow is waiting to push
                  a giant ball onto you when you go up the stairs, bait him into doing so. The ball will break the
                  wall where you were, go into the hole.
                . You'll spot the knight who helped you out of the cell. Talk to him to receive a key and the
                Estus Flask.
                            Estus Flask
                            Aquire Estus Flask.
                . Head up the stairs and open the gate. Take the one way path, and through the fog gate.
                . Boss Fight: Asylum Demon | Using a light attack while falling will perform a plunging attack
                  that will do massive damage. Other than that, get used to learning how to roll and managing
                  stamina.
                . After the fight, open the large doors. I'll make an early mental note here, this hill on the right
                  contains a small bird's nest. This is Snuggly the Crow who lets you trade various items. I'll
                  cover this in a separate section of its own.
                . Head to the top of the hill to complete this area.
                            Reach Lordran
                            Arrive in Lordran.
            Firelink Shrine
                . Welcome to your hub. Firelink Shrine serves as a home base for the entire game, so make
                  sure you're familiar with it.
                . Bonfire: Firelink Shrine | Yes, indeed.
                . In Dark Souls, you can kindle bonfires which increases the number of estus flasks you'll get
                  when resting at that specific bonfire. By default, Bonfire with a Fire keeper present will start
                  at 10 estus flask with every other bonfire starting at 5 estus flask.
                . From the bonfire, you can take the path to the right up the ruin stars. This will lead you to
                  Petrus of Thorolund (husky fellow). If you pester him enough, he'll eventually offer to let you
                  join the Way of White covenant as well as unlocking the achievement. (Knights and Clerics
                  are by default in this covenant)
                            Covenant: Way of White
                            Discover Way of White covenant.
                . From there, loot what you want here. Head towards the aqueducts to proceed to the Undead

          Undead Burg
            . Once you exit the aqueducts, you'll arrive in the Undead Burg. Proceed along the linear path
              to shortly reach your first bonfire.
            . Bonfire: Undead Burg | Just across a wooden bridge after encountering the Hellkite Dragon
            . Now, just before the bonfire, there is a route to your left (from the bonfire) with two spear
              wielding undead. Go down the stairs behind them, then out the door to find the Male
              Undead Merchant.
            . He sells a majority of beginner equipment used to create boss weapons. you will need the
              Resident's Key later on in the Lower Undead Burg.
            . There's a Black Knight here as a note regarding Black Knight weapons.
            . Now continuing from the bonfire, follow the path. Once you start going up some stairs, an
              enemy is gonna roll a barrel onto you. Continue up that tower and a boss fight awaits you
              after the fog gate.
            . Boss: Taurus Demon | When you enter the tower wall area for the boss fight, there's a ladder
              behind you letting you perform the plunging attack on the Taurus Demon. The Taurus Demon
              can jump the platform though, so be careful. He has a chance of dropping the Demon's
              Greataxe, but this can be easily purchased.
            . After the fight, go downstairs and to your left. You'll find Solaire of Astora. Talk to him to
              receive the White Soapstone Sign used for co-op.
            . Onto the bridge, the dragon will definitely blow flames onto you. Your main goal here is to
              make it to the halfway point on the right side and go down the stairs. Keep going down until
              you spot the previous bonfire, kick the ladder down connecting the shortcut. It's safer to bait
              the dragon into blowing fire, then rushing afterwards.
            . From here, go back to the bridge. The obvious point of interest is the Hellkite Dragon.
              Dealing enough damage to his tail will grant the player the Drake Sword for the weapon
              collection, but also serves as an overpowered early weapon, You can use the shortbow and
              shoot the drake's tail until it breaks.
            . You can kill the dragon later. You can also se the dragon to farm souls by having him blow
              fire onto the bridge.
            . Now, you have two options. Completely avoid the dragon, or run under it. Make sure you
              have arrowsand a bow (doesn't have to be stat required). Shoot the Hellkite Dragon to make
              him jump down. Then simply run under him into the gate.

            . Pulling the lever will lift the gate permanently.
            . Head to the right instead to the broken statue for the Covenant: Warrior of Sunlight. Requires
              25 Faith, decreases by 5 per boss beaten as a White Phantom.
                Covenant: Warrior of Sunlight
                Discover Warrior of Sunlight covenant.
            . The tower behind the gate has a Black Knight at the top. The ladder takes you down to some
              rats that connects under the bridge to the Undead Burg bonfire. Rats can be used to farm
              Humanity.
            . Now in this next area, oine of the hollows is going to run behind the gate and close it (the
              one in front of you, not the one you just opened). Go downstairs to the right. In this room,
              you'll find the Mystery Key.
            . Continue onto this linear path, until you reach a fork with a wooden bridge in front of you
              and a stone path to your left. Go straight and then turn right (away from the church). Follow
              this path for a bonfire.
            . Bonfire: Undead Parish | Just above Andre of Astora and connects to Sen's Fortress and Darkroot
            . Now backtrack to the church. Inside is a Berenlike Knight (does not respawn) and a Fire
              Keeper Soul on the coffin. Fire Keeper Souls are used to reinforce Estus Flasks (up to +7).
              Speak to any Fire Keeper to perform this (Firelink Shrine has one just under it in a cage).
            . Above you will be a Channeler (also does not respawn). The only important point of the
              Channeler is that he drops the Channeler's Trident (rare) required for the weapon collection.
            . Before that, under the stairs leading to the channeler is a pair of elevators connecting the
              Undead Church to Firelink Shrine. This is also required in order to revisit the Undead Asylum.
            . Now if you pass the channeler and turn left. You'll see a breakable doorway here. At the top
              is a cell containing Knight Lautrec of Carim. You can free him using the Mystery Key, the
              Master Key also works here. You want to free him so he can give you a Sunlight Medal, and
              later a token of Reprisal related to covenant rewards.
            . SPOILER: Lautrec will move out on his own regardless, but the point of the spoiler is to hide
              the fact that he will kill Anastacia, the Firelink Shrine firekeeper once both bells are rung or
              the player collects both Fire Keeper Soul at each bell location. You will be able to revive her
              later when you take revenge while obtaining the Token of Reprisal. During this period, the
              Firelink Shrine will be not operational. If you do not want this, just kill him now or kick him off
              Lautrec will move out on his own regardless, but the point of the spoiler is to hide the fact that he will kill Anastacia, the Firelink Shrine firekeeper once both bells are rung or the player collects both Fire Keeper Soul at each bell location. You will be able to revive her later when you take revenge while obtaining the Token of Reprisal. During this period, the Firelink Shrine will be not operational. If you do not want this, just kill him now or kick him off the ledge after the Gargoyle Fight in Firelink Shrine.
            . Once you've let him out, you can face the boss of this area on the roof. Where you met the
              Channeler, just take the right path to find some ladders. Both Solaire and Lautrec can be
              summoned here. The Gargoyle's tail can be cut for a weapon, it is not required for Knight's
              Honor.
            . Boss: Bell Gargoyles | There are two gargoyles with the second spawning after a certain
              amount of time. The first has full health with the second coming in with just half health, but
              with fire breathing capabilities.
            . After the fight, climb the ladder, go outside to climb another ladder. Pull the lever to ring the
              bell at the top.

                Ring Bell of Awakening at Undead Church.
            . On the way down, you will find Oswald of Carim who serves as both a merchant, but also the
              Pardoner of sins in Dark Souls. This proves extremely useful when the player starts swapping
              covenants or aggro NPCs.
            . Now, before we move on, head to the front of the church. To your right is a corpse holding a
              Halberd. Halberds cannot be purchased and thus are rare. Keep that in mind. Then at the
              bottom of the stairs is a corpse containing the Basement Key. If the gate is closed, feel free
              to open it.

              lot of damage, or even kill, the rat if you have a very long weapon. Between hits, if you go up

              fight. Head right into the doorway.

              down the ladder. Cross the beam and there will be a torch which is the top of the ladder. Take
              the ladder.
            . From here, head left straight to the bonfire on the support of the bridge.
            . Bonfire: Blighttown Catwalk
            . Continue on your path and take the ladder to the right. You'll then want to take the ladder in
              front of you to go to the giant spider in the well.
            . Pyromancy: Power Within | Just in front of the Craigspider
            . From here, you can make you way all the way down to the swamp.
          Lower Blighttown
            . To the right of the swamp enterance, you'll find a sewer.
            . Bonfire: Blighttown Swamp
            . Pyromancy: Poison Mist | From the bonfire, go forward to the other side of the swamp. The
              pyromancy is on a corpse tucked into the corner on the right.
            . From the bonfire, go right and you should encounter some more scaffolding. This time, this
              will take you to a waterwheel elevator lift. Take it up. Take one ladder up.
            . Sorcery: Remedy | From the first ladder, proceed along the linear path including the very
              narrow branch path to the other side to find this spell.
            . Fire Keeper Soul | From the first ladder, climb up one more ladder. This will lead you to
              another sewer segment loaded with several toxin dart enemies adn fire dogs. The soul is
              located on the lower section behind a sewer grate guarded by two dogs
            . Where you encountered the first toxin dart enemy, there is a ladder here going up. It may be
              difficult to see. Climb it to the top.
            . Key to New Londo Ruins | In a chest next to the last ladder
            . This key will let you unlock the shortcut between Blighttown/Valley of the Drakes/New Londo
              Ruins which connects back to Firelink Shrine.
            . The rest of the loot here isn't required, but you may get them as you wish. If you are having
              trouble with the boss here, you may pick up the set of items two towers the opposite
              direction from the boss from the Poison Mist Pyromancy.
            . Boss: Chaos Witch Quelaag | Overall, a simple boss as most of her attacks are heavily
              telegraphed. Her sword swipes cannot reach point blank so you're able to attack her while
              hugging her as she swings. She spits lava onto the ground that lingers for a period of time.
              The horizontal lava spit takes longer giving you time to get some hits in. Then the only move
              you actually have to be worreid about is when both Quelaag and the Spider somewhat kneel
              telegraphing her explosive attack that deals massive damage and may one shot you. Other
              than that, manage her position away from her lava pools and you're set.
            . After the fight, ring the bell.
                          Ring the Bell (Quelaag's Domain)
                          Ring Bell of Awakening in Quelaag's domain.
            . Now, head downstairs. You should see a doorway or broken wall that leads to a lava area.
              Ignore this doorway, and to the right of that doorway should be a flat wall, roll into it to revela an illusory wall.
            . Talk to the egg guy, so he moves out of your way.
            . Bonfire: Daughter of Chaos
            . Now, also talk to the speechless spider on the wall. You'll eventually get the prompt to enter
              the covenant.

          From Blighttown, you can access several non-required areas that contain important items for
          completing achievements. You may revisit these later if you want.
        
          Valley of the Drakes
            . This place can be accessed from either New Londo Ruins (if you have the New Londo Ruins
              Key), Blighttown, or from Darkroot Basin.
            . You should notice a dragon sleeping. Walk carefully to him. Now you can get one of the two
              loot items that are on the same side; however, you do need both.
            . Knight's Honor: Astora's Straight Sword | The one closer to his hand can be safely picked up.
              A side note is that this sword contains divine properties that will help later on in the
              catacombs.
            . Knight's Honot: Dragon Crest Shield | The one closer to his head cannot be picked up safely.
            . You can risk picking up the item, or you can kill him with poison arrows, or just kill him
              outright. He uses a lot of poison.
            . For Dark Souls veterans, the Red Tearstone Ring is located here on the other side at the top
              of a tower next to the giant closed gates to New Londo Ruins.
        
          The Great Hollow
            . Note: This is a lot of traveling, so if you want to keep this for later when you finish Anor
              Londo, that's fine.
            . From the Blighttown Swamp, the direction away from the Quelaag, you should find a large
              branch that acts like a ramp. Take that path up to a corpse. To the left of the corpse, roll into
              the wall to reveal an illusory wall. You'll then find another chest, roll behind it to reveal yet
              another illusory wall.
            . Proceed to the Great Hollow.
            . Bonfire: The Great Hollow
            . Warning: There are tons of basilisks here, so avoid being cursed. Bring a Purging Stone if you
              want.
            . While there aren't any required items in here, you'll find tons of chunks and crystal lizards
              here that will make leveling up equipment later much easier.
            . Make you way to the bottom of the trunk.
        
          Ash Lake
            . Once you enter ash lake and walk down the trunk, you should see the bonfire to the right.
            . Bonfire: Ash Lake
            . Now, the first thing you'll notice is probably the Hydra here. Fight it if you'd like for souls.
              There's also a few Dragon Scales that you can pick up here.
            . Halfway through the lake, you should see a giant tree on the left. Climb up the root ramp.
              Now shortly after you're going up, you should keep your eyes peeled for a hollow trunk
              UNDER th epath you;re taking (this is OUTSIDE of the vertical trunk).
            . Miracle: Great Magic Barrier | If you dropped into the hollow trunk, it will lead you to a corpse
              with this spell.
            . Continue down the lake to the end.
            . Bonfire: Stone Dragon
            . First off, talk to the dragon to prompt the covenant joining

                          Discover Path of the Dragon covenant.

          With both bells rang, Sen's Fortress will be open now.
        
          Sen's Fortress
            . I hope you like platformers!
            . Siegmeyer of Catarina was sitting outside of here if you talked to him. If you didn't, he will
              relocate inside regardless. His quest remains active, and you will need his quest for a miracle.
            . Be wary of pressure plates and misplaced enemies. This is also your first place that you will
              enocunter a mimic. I'll mention it now, the way to determine if a chest is a mimic is by
              looking at the chain on the right side of the chest. If the chain is pointing TOWARDS you as
              you look up at the chest from the front, that's a mimic. Regular chest chain will curl to the right
              up and up.
            . Enter the fortress, follow the linear path. Now, once you make it passed the first two
              catwalks with swinging blades, you'll be in a room with a chest. The NEXT room will be a
              catwalk with an enemy. This room is a point of interest as you will need to return here with
              the Cage Key. If you have the Master Key, that will do at this point too; however, we will still
              want the Cage Key.
            . Continue to the next area which is a ramp that contains a boulder rolling on it. Let the
              boulder kill the first enemy, then once a boulder passes, run up the ramp and to the left to
              the fog gate. You can get the item at the top in the chest if you want. Go through the fog
              gate.
            . In this next room, you'll get an ambushing enemy as well as another path to the boulder.
            . With the boulder here, you CAN actually run up and make it to the room untouched, but its a
              very narrow margin.
            . Instead, once a boulder passes, run up the ramp halfway then drop off onto a wooden
              platform with a caster enemy. Go towards the doorway.
            . Sorcery: Hush | On the corpse in this room
            . Go out the other direction and go up the ramp. You will now be located at the boulder
              mechanism and can direct it any path you want.
            . Sidequest: Siegmeyer of Catarina | Make sure it's not pointing outside whre you first
              encountered the boulder, and head out that way using the boulder path. If you drop off to
              your left, you should find Siegmeyer sitting on the ledge. Exhaust his dialogue.
            . Return to the boulder mechanism.
            . Return down the ramp that you just ascended from (right after Hush) and go left. You will see
              an elevator in here. Before getting on the elevator, MAKE SURE it goes up before getting on,
              then get on as it's going back down.
            . Item of Interest: Lightning Spear | Mimic in this room
            . Now. walk out of the room and you will see that the boulders will slot down into the hole
              here. Once the hole fills up, the next boulder will smash the wall open.
            . Item of interest: Covetous Gold Serpent Ring | If you're brave, run in and get the item.
              Otherwise, return to the mechanism and turn it clockwise then retrieve the item safely.
            . Once that's done, return ot the boulder mechanism.
            . Siegward Questline: You can walk out to the FIRST path that you encountered the boulder.
              Drop off to the left for a Shotel. Then drop off agin to find Siegward sitting on the ledge.
              Talk to him and exhaust his dialogue.
            . Return to the boulder mechanism and head into the hallway. Follow the linear path until you
              reach the fog gate.
            . Once you're through the fog gate, you'll be on the roof. First off, go upstairs, twice and then
              you'll see a broken wall off to your right. This ledge will let you drop down to a bonfire.
            . Bonfire: Sen's Fortress
            . Item of Interest: Flame Stoneplate Ring | On the roof, at the lower end in a chest guarded by
              Balder Knights.
            . Make your way up four sets of stairs, then follow the wide catwalk. Take the right (left is a
              jump that we'll do later). You'll get another fork, left takes you to a balder knight, go right. In
              this room, you'll need the cage key to unlock the shortcut. Go upstairs some more and onto
              the catwalk where a crossbow hollow is shooting at you. Get by him to the final area.
            . The fog gate leads to the boss, ignore this for now.
            . Go upstairs and kill the giant. He's the giant throwing fire everywhere and he DOES throw fire
              into the boss arena.
            . Key Item: Cage Key | The first fork on the large catwalk, you can jump across if you jump on
              the left side. Make the jump, then in the tower go all the way down and find the Cage Key at
              the end.
            . With the Cage Key, you can unlock the cage shortcut just before the boss. Make sure to go in
              it so that the shortcut is activated.
            . Sidequest: Big Hat Logan | Head back to the boulder mechanism and sen djust one boulder
              down the straight path then rotate it. Head down the path, and the wlal will be broken here.
              Unlock both cages here, you'll free Big Hat Logan for his questline as he moves to Firelink
              Shrine.
            . Quest Note: You will need 15 INT before Logan teaches you at this time. You can wait later
              for him to lower his requirements completely.
            . Now, when you're ready, just head up to the boss fight.
            . Boss Fight: Iron Golem | He's big, but his attacks are fairly telegraphed. You can hug his feet
              for most of the fight, except when he goes for his grab attack. Besides that and falling off,
              should be an easy but long fight.

              revive unless necromancers are killed. Necromancers DO NOT respawn.
            . Another note here is that Blacksmith Vamos is located here where you will be doing all your
              upgrades regarding Chaos and Fire given that you have the respective embers given to him.
              This guide will unlock all the bonfires here so that returning to this point will become easier.
            . From firelink shrine, run towards the graveyard and you should find some stairs leading to
              the catacombs.
            . Once inside, if you have a divine weapon or spells then you can fight freely. Otherwise, just
              run through.
            . Run into the area, down the spiral stairs, and into the next area. Climb down the ladder, and
              enter the door to the left. The next area has a hole in the wall to the left, go through there to
              find a Necromancer and the first Bonfire.
            . Bonfire: The Catacombs
            . First warning here: the statues are traps with spikes. Be wary. Second warning here:
              Walkways need to be activated before you can walk on them. So avoid rolling onto platforms
              below you until you know you've unlocked them.
            . Walk outside, the first necromancer is to your right. Either runb to him, or kill him from range.
            . Head through the very linear path. When you return outside, head to the right where you'll
              find several flying skulls and skeletons. Run through all of these adn hit the switch at the end
              to rotate the bridge. The next necromancer is at the end of the bridge. You can kill him
              before hand.
            . Proceed to the next area. Here, make your way to the very bottom through all the skeletons
              to find your next necromancer and the next switch.
            . Now from here, if you drop down the spiral staircase some more you'll meet Blacksmith
              Vamos who will open up a path at the bottom. By this point, you are actually in the next area.
              So don't go here yet, just remember it's here.
            . Head back up and you should see a small narrow pathway leading outside to a dead end and
              a drop off to the right. Before going outside, there's a narrow path to the left that will also
              lead you outside. Take this path.
            . Head to the end of the path, climb up the ladder and use the switch. The wall next to the
              bottom of the ladder is an illusory wall and takes you to the bonfire.

            . With that, head across the newly rotated bridge and into the next area. You can kick the
              skeletons off the ledge here outside, but you'll need to go into the broken wall room with
              several skeletons here. Drop off, go straight into the room.

              pathway to find the necromancer here.
            . Miracle: Tranquil Walk of Peace | From the necromancer, go upstairs and you'll find the spell
            . In this room, you can walk over one of the graves that will give you and put you back to where you can
              drop off, you will need to drop off here. The closest path is right before the previous bonfire.
              Once here, drop off to the right and you'll find a Great Scythe and a hole in the tomb. (You
              need to walk over it to reveal it). This will drop you to the next area. Go into the doorway and
              you'll find a prowling demon. Kill it or don't, but make sure to loot the Eyes of Death (3x)
              behind him.
            . To his left, you should see an open coffin, get inside that coffin and wait until you are

              this quickly. Once the lord of this area dies (Tomb of Giants boss), the covenant becomes
              unavailable.
            . Transport back to the Catacombs using the small coffin, from there simply walk into the next
              area and climb down. The gound here will break in the center if you walk over it. Make your
              way all the way down to the bottom.
            . This area houses several Pinwheel Skeletons, they're extremely dangerous so dispatch of
              them carefully. Once you make your way across the gauntlet of pinwheels, you'll get to the

              Rhea of Thorolund and you must save her from some enemies. If you happen to save her

              point, she will sell miracles for a period of time. That period ends if you kill a combination of

              of Chaos, Iron Golem, O&S, Four Kings and Seath. Bosses killed prior to saving her do not

              tolerable The only attack that's truly dangerous is when one hugs itself and starts glowing
              with magic. This is a large blast which may kill you one hit. The strategy here is to deal
              DPS and ability to doge. When a king dies, you can actually still hit him while he's in the
              dying animation to deal more damage to the boss health pool (hence Three Kings
